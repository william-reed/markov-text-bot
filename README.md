Put in some input text in groups delimited by new lines and see what you get.
If output is identical to input, adjust `MAX_GROUP_SIZE` down for less coherent, yet more random sentences.
More than 100k lines of input with group sizes of 3 would give reasonable results.

Use the `pics-10k.txt` file of post titles from /r/pics for sample data.
